Thank you for using the Joomietool!  It is still in its beta stages but we do everything we can to make it safe to use!  We will not make a function usable unless
we have tested it and found it to be safe to the website.  However, use at your own risk.  We currently have the following functions available:

          juser - changes the username and password used to access the administrator page
          jcore - updates the core Joomla files. Supports 2.5, 3.2, and 3.3.  It is not recommended to update between versions such as 2.5.x to 3.2.x
          jdb   - shows the database information for the selected joomla folder
          jmove - Moves the website from one folder to another.
